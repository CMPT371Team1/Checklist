# Checklist
There is a lot going on in your life, and this course requires you to do multiple things and it is very easy to forget. Don't worry, your project lead has got your back!
Come here every couple of days to make sure you are on top of all the things.

###General Checklist:
1. Have I looked at the material for an upcoming code review session? 
    Go here to check for upcoming code reviews and path to get to the material: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g3CfvlI1erdg2zaHZlVyh6uQ-rYQ6L5Cay0YIn2UETk/edit?usp=sharing
2. Have I done a pair programming session with a buddy lately? If so, have I documented it in CMPT371Team1/Documentation/Pair-Programming-Sessions?
3. Am I on top of documenting my contribution and other documentations? Go here if you haven't: CMPT371Team1/Documentation/ActivityLog-Individual
4. Am I SURE I am on top of documentation? Am I REALLY SURE?
5. Have I communicated with my Test/Dev buddy lately?
6. Are there any **risks** I see coming? If so, report them now to Ryan or your PL.
7. While you are here, might as well check the mini-milestone status to stay in the loop!
100. It is very easy to just stick to this timeline. Remember, this is not everything. Is there a deliverable coming up soon? Perhaps you have YOUR code review session coming up. Have you provided everybody with your artifact yet? Maybe you have to be the presenter at the next ID presentation. Make sure you are preparing for that. Maybe you are a part of the triage team for this ID. If you are, ensure you know what's going on with that.
