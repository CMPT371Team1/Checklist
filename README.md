# Checklist
There is a lot going on in your life, and this course requires you to do multiple things and it is very easy to forget. Don't worry, your project lead has got your back!
Come here every couple of days to make sure you are on top of all the things.

Have you provided everybody with your artifact yet? Maybe you have to be the presenter at the next ID presentation. Make sure you are preparing for that.
